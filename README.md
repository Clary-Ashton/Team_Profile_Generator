## Description

This profile generator is a command line application that allows you to build your team, including a manager, engineers and interns. We will capture each team member's name, ID, and email as well as the Manager's office number, an Engineer's github account, and the school an intern is attending.

Future state, this information will be used to generate a website that will display all of this information for you as well as provide the ability to email team members and review and Engineer's work on their Github page.
